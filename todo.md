## clean up the repo

delete mcc binary, instead add the cover repo as a git submodule or whatever

put example xc and mcc files in some dir

put mccw.py problem parsing/loading code into its own file. have it produce a type that's solver agnostic, that can then be passed to the CP-SAT based and other solvers
